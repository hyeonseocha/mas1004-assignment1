    Do these six steps, in this order:
        1. Convert to RGB with image.convert("RGB"). Some of your files are
           grayscale, and some are PNGs with transparency.
        2. Resize so that the shorter side is RESIZE pixels and the picture
           keeps its shape, with bilinear interpolation. A 1000 x 500 photo
           becomes 512 x 256.
        3. Cut out the CROP x CROP square in the middle. Whatever sticks out
           on the long side is thrown away.
        4. Divide by 255, so that every value is between 0.0 and 1.0.
        5. For each channel c, subtract MEAN[c] and then divide by STD[c].
        6. Put the channels first: shape (3, 224, 224), not (224, 224, 3).
           Row 0 is red, row 1 is green, row 2 is blue.

    list, and return a numpy array, not a torch tensor.

    different, the self test badge at the top of your page turns red.
